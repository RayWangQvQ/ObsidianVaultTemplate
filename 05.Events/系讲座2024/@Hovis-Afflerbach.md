# Missing Massive Stripped Stars at Low Metallicity


### Comment:: Beryl talked about what stripped stars are and using simulation code to investigate their mass distributions. And find out that more massive stars are less stripped. There are also "wolf-?" stars which are similar to stripped stars but not sure what the definitions are. And Stripped stars can be the progenitor of stripped SN and BBH or BNS.
