# Probing circumgalactic gas using Ne VIII absorption lines
### Content
- baryon cycle and galaxy formation big questions:
	- how does gas get from cosmic web/CGM into galaxies
	- how is star formation regulated in galaxies
	- how/why central galaxies quenched?
	- theoretically uncertain: diff mechanism using with diff simulations
- multi-phase CGM
	- cool: $10^4  \dim{K}$, clumpy; easier to observe UV absorption lines; hard to simulate need high res
	- warm-hot: $10^6  \dim{K}$ volume-filling; hard to observe mostly X-ray lines; easier to simulate larger structures
	- Ne VIII: absorption lines at $770,780 ~\dim{\ang}$
