# Growth of Massive Stars in Star Clusters

### Content
**Background**
- IMBH in star clusters
	- How can we form IMBH in star clusters?
	- other open questions
- Method
	- create a large grid of models across all possible initial conditions
	- number of stars, initial mass function, radius etc.
- Globular Cluster
	- old, massive, compact

**Summary**
- [ ] IMBH are not likely to live in star cluster?

### Comment:: Elena gave a great talk concluded her paper. She used a large set of simulations (~300) varying initial condition parameters, and see after $10 Myr$ what the maximum mass is and connect that to IMBH.
