# Why Won’t We Stop Talking About Gamma-ray Bursts?

### Content
- GRB
	- source: binary neutron star colliding (short) or stars exploding (long)
	- afterglow: synchrotron after GRB; radio/optical/X-ray
- Long GRB
	- tracer as star formation but biased in near redshift
	- unbiased at z~5, maybe because metal not rich at that redshift
- Short GRB
	- kilonova produced
- GW events and EM counterpart
	- GW170817: SGRB + afterglow + kilonova detected
	- GW190425: no SGRB, and two NS masses very big (above 5 sigma)
- SGRB indications
	- host galaxy environment
	- progenitor systems
	- kilonova properties
	- burst properties
	- nature of the merger remnant
- Weird GRB
	- The BOAT (brightest of all time)
- observational details:
	- optical
	- x-ray: SWIFT/ CHANDRA/XXM-Newton etc.
	- radio: VLT/ALMA etc.

### Comment:: A great talk summarized GRB indication and observations. Especially talked about how GW connected GRB works.
