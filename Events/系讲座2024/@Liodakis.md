# Understanding Tidal Disruption Events through their polarized emission

> [!Cite] Abstract
>Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) offer a real-time view on the very early stages of accretion disk and jet formation not possible with any other black hole system. Polarization can be a very important probe of the magnetic field and physical conditions near black holes, and recent observations have demonstrated that optical TDEs can be highly polarized. These very high levels of polarization can be the pathway to shed much needed light on the early accretion disk formation mechanism, and the dichotomy of X-ray/Optical TDEs. I will discuss recent results and current efforts to understand the origin of the polarized emission from TDEs.

### Content
- TDE fuels AGN
- TDE event $10^-5/year$
- duration: days/months?
- diff TDE
	- xray
	- xray reprocessing to optical/UV
	- tidal shocks during accretion disk formation: gas not losing angular momentum so makes shock when they falling to BH
**summary**
- TDEs can be highly polarized
- polarization angle changes are common in TDEs

### Comment:: this talk gives some examples of how polarizations can be used to analyze TDE event, to see observation corresponds to which model and more other theories. But in general the details I cannot understand any of them.
